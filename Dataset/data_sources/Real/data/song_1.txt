There is a world, that is virtual and different
It can be so cold, make us stand up for what's right
Our hopes through our life, if we reset it to the start

Here we are, going far, to save all that we love
If we give, all we've got, we will make it through
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world
Today, make evil go away

We'll reset it all
Be there when you call
We will stand real tall
Stronger after all

A world of machines, it can shadow human nature
And all that we need, is the way to find the answer
But one thing is sure, you can count on us for good

Here we're going far, to save all that we love
If we give all we've got, we will make it through
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world
Today we make evil go away

We'll reset it all
Be there when you call
We will stand real tall
Stronger after all

We'll do our best, to never let you down
We're up to the test, to turn this world around

Here we are, going far
To save all that we love
If we give, all we've got
We will make it through
Here we are, like a star
Shining bright on your world
Today make evil go away

Here we are, going far
To save all that we love
If we give, all we've got
We will make it through
Here we are, like a star
Shining bright on your world
Today make evil go away
